# MVC
Architectural Patterns


Language : Swift 4.2
Platform : Xcode 10


MVC

1. Model is responsible for maintaining application data and business logic.

2. View is a user interface of the application, which displays the data.

3. Controller handles user's requests and renders appropriate View with Model data.


Advantage
1. Faster development process
2. Ability to provide multiple views
3. Support for asynchronous technique
4. Modification does not affect the entire model
5. MVC model returns the data without formatting


Disadvantages
1. Increased complexity
2. Inefficiency of data access in view
3. Difficulty of using MVC with modern user interface.
